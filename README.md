#  Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

 **Internship Project - CodeClause**
- **Project ID:** #CC69853  
- **Domain:** Data Science  
- **Duration:** July 1, 2025 ‚Äì July 31, 2025

##  Project Overview

This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to perform customer segmentation using a shopping mall dataset. Clustering is an **unsupervised learning technique**, and here we use it to group customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**.

---

##  Objective

> **Segment customers into distinct groups** based on their purchasing behavior to help businesses implement personalized marketing strategies.

---

##  Technologies Used

- Python 
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib

---

##  Dataset

- Dataset: `Mall_Customers.csv`
- Source: Kaggle (search: "Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset")
- Features used for clustering:
  - Annual Income (k$)
  - Spending Score (1‚Äì100)

---

##  Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3.  **Feature Selection**
4.  **Elbow Method to Find Optimal Clusters**
5.  **K-Means Clustering**
6.  **Visualize Clusters with Scatter Plot**

## üîç Insights

- **5 optimal clusters** were identified.
- Customers were grouped by **spending patterns and income levels**.
- Useful for targeted marketing, loyalty programs, and product promotions.

---

##  How to Run

1. Make sure required packages are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Open the notebook or Python file in VS Code or Jupyter.

Run the script to see the clusters and elbow graph.
